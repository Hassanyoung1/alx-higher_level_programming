# JavaScript - Web scraping

## Scripting API JavaScript

# Learning Objectives
 At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:


# General
* Why JavaScript programming is amazing
* How to manipulate JSON data
* How to use request and fetch API
* How to read and write a file using fs module

# More Info
# Install Node 14
** $ curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_14.x | sudo -E bash -
** $ sudo apt-get install -y nodejs
# Install semi-standard

# Documentation

* $ sudo npm install semistandard --global
* Install request module and use it
* Documentation

* $ sudo npm install request --global
* $ export NODE_PATH=/usr/lib/node_modules

## Notes: * Request module has been deprecated since February 2020 - the team is considering alternative to replace this module - however, itâ€™s a really simple and powerful module for practicing web-scraping in JavaScript (and still used a lot in the industry).
