## Requirements
### General

- All curl commands must have the option `-s` (silent mode).
- All Python scripts will be tested on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using Python 3 (version 3.8.5).
- The first line of all Python files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/python3`.
- Code should adhere to PEP 8 standards (use `pycodestyle` version 2.8.*).
- All modules, classes, and functions should be documented appropriately.

## Project Structure
The project is organized with the following structure:
- `bash/`: Directory containing Bash scripts.
- `python/`: Directory containing Python scripts.
- `README.md`: This file providing an overview and guidelines for the project.

## Usage
To run the scripts in the project, follow these guidelines:
### Bash Scripts
1. Navigate to the `bash/` directory.
2. Make the script executable if not already (`chmod +x script.sh`).
3. Run the script (`./script.sh`).
### Python Scripts
1. Navigate to the `python/` directory.
2. Make the script executable if not already (`chmod +x script.py`).
3. Run the script (`./script.py`).

## Testing
All scripts have been tested on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS and Python 3.8.5.

## Dependencies
- `python3`: Version 3.8.5.
- `pycodestyle`: Version 2.8.*.

## Documentation
Ensure that all modules, classes, and functions are documented. To check documentation for a module or class, use the following commands:
```bash
python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)'
python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.__doc__)'
